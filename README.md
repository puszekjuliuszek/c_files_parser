This is a fork from [Maksim Berezov's Cubic Tiling Prediction](https://github.com/maxberezov/cubic_tiling)

# Built With:
python 3.8

# Install Requierements

# Starting optimization process

This is a repo which is used in [CRIntern repository](https://github.com/puszekjuliuszek/CRIntern) as a tool, so it do 
not have a demo. to use it in your case you should run 
```angular2html
python3 main.py
```
but it will try to parse files in loop_generator directory which probabnly do not exists for you, so I suggest you to 
do small changes in main.py and change paths
